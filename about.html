          My freshman year of high school I tried coding for the first time. It was pretty simple coding but I enjoyed it. Throughout my high school years<br>
          I was still trying to figure out what I wanted to do. I played sports like soccer and track and I really enjoyed it. I wish I started earlier<br>

          Implement what I learned from this class into cryptocurrency and developing apps in the future because I am really interested in it.
